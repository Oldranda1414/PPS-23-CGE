The View has not been tested because of time restrains.

## Technology

Scala Test has been used for unit testing.

## Coverage

Using Scoverege the test coverage has been calculated to be 67.72%.

The team had set the goal to keep the test coverage of the project over 80% but due to time constrains this could not be achieved before the final deadline.

The main culprit of the low test coverage is the `GameController.scala` file, which has not been tested due to time constrains.

The full report can be generated by running the gradle task `checkScoverage`. The report will be located at `build/reports/scoverage`.

## Metodology

Most of the source code has been developed using Test-Driven-Development.
