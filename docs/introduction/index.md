# Introduction

The Card Game Engine is a powerful domain-specific language (DSL) designed to empower its users to easily define a given card game using easy to read syntax.

```scala
Game is "Simple Game"
Game has player called "Andrea"
Game has player called "Filippo"
Game has player called "Leonardo"

Game players have 3 cards in hand
Game players have random cards in hand

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game cards have 3 values called "one" "two" "three"
Game cards have 3 suits called "clubs" "hearts" "diamonds"
```
