## Sprint review

The team managed to partially complete the first ruleset expansion and the refactoring of the GUI, although some noticible bugs are still present.

The team has reflected on changing the style of items in the sprint backlog, focusing more on items that reflect added functonalities as a whole and not reporting refactoring chores.

The stakeholders are happy with the current state of the project and hopefull for future sprint results.

The Product Owner added some additional feature requirements, such as :
    - the game window should be resizable

## Sprint retrospective

The team had a productive sprint, although work subdivision can still be improved. Focus on implementing complete functionalities, instead of developer oriented production should improve stakeholders and Product Owner sadisfaction.

Also documentation and testing should be improved.
