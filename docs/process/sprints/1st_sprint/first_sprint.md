### Sprint Goal

This is a first organizational sprint, with the goal of setting up the project.

### Deadline

The sprint deadline is 21/09/2024.

## Sprint Review

The team did not manage to finish all the project configuration tasks, so they are set to be finished during the first days of the second sprint.

## Sprint Retrospective

The team has noted that the initial size estimate was underrated for the Quality Assurance Configuration task. The team is learning how to correctly estimate tasks.

Also unexpected dependencies between tasks have arisen, slowing down work.
