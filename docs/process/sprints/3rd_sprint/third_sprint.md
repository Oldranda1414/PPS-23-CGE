# Third Sprint

## Sprint Planning

The [sprint backlog](third_sprint_backlog.md) was drafted.

### Sprint Goal

The third sprint's goals are implementing the first item of the product backlog

### Deadline

The sprint deadline is 05/10/2024.

## Sprint review

The team managed to complete only the frist item from the sprint backlog apart from the documentation. The Product Owner has considered redefining the product backlog, in light to the teams slow development but no definitive action has been taken yet.

The stakeholders are happy with the first working demo of the project and hopefull for future sprint results.

## Sprint retrospective

With a completely configured project, the team managed to produce a general structure of the project, although item time estimations seem to still be undershot, even if a speedup in development is foreseen by the team.
